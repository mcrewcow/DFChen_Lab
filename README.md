# IGFBPL1 is a Master Driver of Microglia Homeostasis and Resolution of Inflammation that Limits Glaucomatous Neurodegeneration

This repository has the information on the single-cell RNA-seq analysis described in the paper for IGFBPL1 WT/KO and glaucoma PBS/IGFBPL1 mouse microglia datasets.

The analysis is separated into the following parts:
1. Igfbpl1 WT/KO - glaucoma PBS/Igfbpl1 Seurat R processing - file:\
2. ForceAtlas2 + scanpy processing (Jupyter Notebook) - file:\
3. RNA Velocity - bash preprocessing to .loom - file: [fastq_to_loom_processing.sh](https://github.com/mcrewcow/Pan_et_al_DFChen_IGFPL1_paper/blob/main/fastq_to_loom_processing.sh)\
                - scvelo utilization (Jupyter Notebook) - file:\
                
The datasets are uploaded on GEO:\


The processed datasets are available at:
